                <h2>Whet Even Is This Website?</h2>
                <p>This is a dumping ground for my thoughts ideas, techy projects and whatever else takes my interest. 
                    It's a proving ground for my cloud and AWS skills. 
                    It's a blog but also somewhere I can host some of the little tools that my meandering existence has insentivised me to create.
                    I share and expand it in a hope that it will be ove some use to thers, be it accademically, theologically, or otherwise.

                <p>
                    The website is constantly under construction. Part of my interest is how to host a dynamic website at as low a cost as posible.
                    In that I include cost in time as well as money.
                    Currently I'm interested in turning this into a small business venture to help small businesses get online.
                    The cost of that on my time as a provider is also a factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to say that my interests are individually ephemerial, so stay turned for whatever is next!
